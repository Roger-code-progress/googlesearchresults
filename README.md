Goal for this project is to create the webpage from "https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage" 
It is part of the extended difficulty of The Odin Project of recreating google.com.
In the basic version, i had quite a few unnecessary codes that would have wasted lines and caused the file to be bigger.
The goal of me attempting the harder difficulty is to have a fresh start and hopefully reduce the amount of lines required to finish the entire thing.
